<h2>A little about Study Fox</h2>
    <div class="one">
    Study Fox is a novel idea that connects students that want to study with other students who have the same goal in mind, to succeed in their classes. This idea was thought up and created by team Super Seniors during the 2017 Boise State Appathon. We all want to succeed in our classes and this application will connect students with other students that want to work together.
